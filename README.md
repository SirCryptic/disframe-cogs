# DisFrame-Cogs

Welcome to **DisFrame-Cogs**, the community-driven cog repository for the [DisFrame Discord bot framework](https://github.com/sircryptic/disframe)! This is your hub for sharing and discovering custom cogs to enhance your DisFrame bot with new commands, games, utilities, and more—built by the community, for the community.

## What is DisFrame?

DisFrame is a modular Discord bot framework written in Python using `discord.py`. It’s designed for extensibility, allowing you to easily plug in cogs to add features like moderation tools, interactive games, or custom utilities. Learn more at the [DisFrame repo](https://github.com/sircryptic/disframe).

## Purpose

This repository hosts a growing collection of community-created cogs to supercharge your DisFrame bot. Whether you’re looking for an economy game like CoinRush or a unique server tool, you’ll find contributions here to enrich your Discord experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A running DisFrame bot instance (see the [Hosting Guide](https://sircryptic.github.io/DisWeb/pages/guide.html)).
- Familiarity with Python and Discord bot commands.

### Adding Cogs
Enhance your DisFrame bot with these steps:

1. **Explore Available Cogs**:
   - Browse the folders in this repo (e.g., `Games/CoinRush`) to find cogs that suit your needs.

2. **Download a Cog**:
   - Each cog folder contains a `.py` file (e.g., `coinrush.py`) and may include a `README.md` with instructions.
   - Some cogs come with an `assets` folder for resources like images or fonts.

3. **Install the Cog**:
   - Copy the `.py` file to your DisFrame bot’s `cmds/` directory (or a subfolder like `cmds/games/` for organization—DisFrame supports this).
   - If an `assets` folder is included, place it in your DisFrame root directory (beside `bot.py`) to ensure resources load correctly.

4. **Run Your Bot**:
   - Start your bot with `python bot.py`. The cog will load automatically.
   - Refer to the cog’s `README.md` for any specific setup steps or usage commands.

## Available Cogs

Here’s a peek at some cogs you can add:
- **[CoinRush](/Games/CoinRush#readme)**: An economy game featuring jobs, items, trading, achievements, and a casino.
